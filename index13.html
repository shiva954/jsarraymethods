    <h3>Bank Transaction Validator
        Scenario: You’re designing a system to check if a user has sufficient funds for a transaction.
        Problem: Determine if a user can make a withdrawal based on their balance and withdrawalAmount.
        Input:
        balance (float),
        withdrawalAmount (float).
        Conditions:
        If balance ≥ withdrawalAmount, allow the transaction.
        If balance < withdrawalAmount, reject the transaction. </h3>
            <h3>open console for output</h3>
            <script>


                let balance = Number(prompt("enter your balance:"));
                let withdraw = Number(prompt("enter the amount to withdraw:"));
                if (balance >= withdraw) {
                    console.log(`transaction approved`);
                }
                else {
                    console.log(`insufficient funds`);
                }
