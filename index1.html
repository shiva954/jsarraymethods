        Product Discount
        Scenario: Imagine you work at an e-commerce company where discounts are applied to customer purchases. Your code
        will help automate this calculation.
        Problem: Given a total purchase amount, calculate the discount and print the final amount.
        Input: An integer totalAmount, representing the total purchase amount.
        Conditions:
        If totalAmount > 500, apply a 20% discount.
        If totalAmount is between 200 and 500, apply a 10% discount.
        If totalAmount < 200, no discount is applied. Expected Output: The final amount after applying the discount.
            Example: Input: totalAmount=600 Output: 480 (600 - 20% of 600) </h3>

            <h3>open console for output</h3>
            <script>
                let totalAmount = Number(prompt("please enter the total amount:"));
                if (totalAmount < 200) {
                    console.log(`sorry there is no discount for total amount under 200$`);
                }
                else if (totalAmount > 200 && totalAmount < 500) {
                    let discount = (10 / 100) * totalAmount;
                    console.log(`congratulations you get 10% discount.your total amount after the discount is : ${totalAmount - discount}`);
                }
                else if (totalAmount > 500) {
                    let discount = (20 / 100) * totalAmount;
                    console.log(`congratulations you get 20% discount.your total amount after the discount is : ${totalAmount - discount}`);
                }
