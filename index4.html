    <h3>Library Late Fees
        Scenario: A library management system where fines are automatically calculated for late book returns.
        Problem: Calculate the total fine based on the number of lateDays.
        Input: Integer lateDays.
        Conditions:
        If lateDays is between 1-5, the fine is $2 per day.
        If lateDays is between 6-10, the fine is $3 per day.
        If lateDays > 10, the fine is $5 per day.
        Expected Output: Total fine amount.
        Example:

    <script>
        let lateDays = Number(prompt("enter number of late days:"));

        if (lateDays >= 1 && lateDays <= 5) {
            console.log(`the fine amount to pay is: ${lateDays * 2}`);
        }
        else if (lateDays >= 6 && lateDays <= 10) {
            console.log(`the fine amount to pay is: ${lateDays * 3}`);
        }
        else if (lateDays > 10) {
            console.log(`the fine amount to pay is: ${lateDays * 5}`);
